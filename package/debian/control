Description: improved Xaw widget set development package
 XawPlus is a clone of the original Xaw library, providing a more up to date
 look and some extensions to the original Athena widget set. This library is
 as compatible as possible to the original. It should  be possible to compile
 the source code of an Xaw client without any changes (except the include path
 of the XawPlus header files) to get the new look of XawPlus to this client.
 .
 XawPlus makes it possible to use XPM pixmaps, tooltips, a truncate mechanism
 for too long label strings and UTF8 coded UNICODE labels without changing the
 code of your application.
